# MongoDB $in Operator with Single Element
This repository demonstrates an uncommon error related to the use of the `$in` operator in MongoDB queries with only one element. The `$in` operator is designed for checking if a value exists within an array, but it's not the most efficient way to test for equality with a single value.

The `bug.js` file showcases the incorrect implementation, where `$in` is used with a single element, leading to inefficient query execution.

The `bugSolution.js` file provides the corrected implementation, using the equality operator for better performance.
